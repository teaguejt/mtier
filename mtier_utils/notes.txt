Some experiments:
  1) Stream on fast node (no migration) (use numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1)
  2) Stream on slow node (no migration) (use numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=0)
  3) Migration enabled, rate=100ms, no shootdowns (as is)
  4) Migration enabled, rate=100ms, targeted shootdowns (only for slow copies)
  5) Migration enabled, rate=100ms, slow copy everything (with shootdowns)
  6) Migration enabled, rate=100ms, fast copy everything (no shootdowns, but don't
                        change the set you copy after the startup)
  Use ktime to look at migration overhead
    For 1-6, get performance
    For 3-6, get time spent doing migration, and number of pages migrated
    (fast and slow)
