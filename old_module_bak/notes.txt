2 bugs we need to fix:
  1) The module does not release memory from the original process after the
     process exits. I think we need to call 'putback_movable_pages(pagelist)' after 

  2) Many pages are in a bad state when we remove the module. I'm not sure if
     these are pages we create or pages from the process (likely module
     We need to clean up the page flags on module exit.

Some testing that we need to do:
  1) Highest priority is that we ensure the copying / map flipping actually
     works asynchronously. There is good reason to think that it does -- but I
     haven't convinced myself yet.

  2) The module right now does not flush TLB's. We should write a version that
     flushes the TLB's. We need a version that migrates synchronously as well.


Other things:
  1) Add this to a repo ASAP

Netconsole debugging:

On brazil, open a screen session and do:

$ nc -l 1185 > tmp.out

In another screen, do:

$ tail -f tmp.out

On ecuador, open a screen session and do:

tail -f /var/log/messages | nc brazil.eecs.utk.edu 1185
